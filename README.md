The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens. I am using data collected from 2000 through 2015 for six countries that repersent the range of country socieconomic characteristics. The data has been compared from several different perspective to show various ways that GDP and Life Expectancy relate to each other, or to the contrary, if they have no strong correlation at all.

The six subject countries are:

- Chile
- China
- Germany
- Mexico
- The United States
- and, Zimbabwe
