## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to investigate if there is a strong correlation between the economic output of a country and the life expectancy of its citizens. I am using data collected from 2000 through 2015 for six countries that repersent the range of the socieconomic characteristics found in countries aroud the world. The data has been compared from several different perspectives to show various ways that GDP and Life Expectancy relate to each other, or to the contrary, if they have no strong correlation at all.

The six subject countries are:
- Chile
- China
- Germany
- Mexico
- The United States
- and, Zimbabwe

GDP stands for Gross Domestic Product. GDP is a monetary measure of the market value of all final goods and services produced in a time period. The GDP values are in in Trillions of current US dollars.

GDP Source: [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.MKTP.CD) national accounts data, and OECD National Accounts data files.

Life expectancy Data Source: [World Health Organization](http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.688)

**Focusing Questions:**
- Has life expectancy increased over time in the six nations?
- Has GDP increased over time in the six nations?
- Is there a correlation between GDP and life expectancy of a country?
- What is the average life expactancy in these nations?
- What is the distribution of that life expectancy?

## The data

I now present the data showing any relationship between GDP and Life Expectancy. To show any relationships, I have generated four seperate plots that show the data from various interresting perspectives.

### Life expectancy distribution

Here is a violin plot showing the distribution of life expectancy ages per country. The shape of the distributions is a histogram showing the number of occurances of each age in the range.
